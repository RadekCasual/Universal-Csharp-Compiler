# Universal-Csharp-Compiler
Universal C# compiler made in batch.
This program works by compiling your C# code into an .exe file automatically.

# Instructions:
1. Download the .bat file to your computer
2. Open it
3. Select the .cs file from the menu
4. Once the work is done, the program will close automatically and the finished .exe file will appear in the same location as the .bat file

# FAQ:

1. Will the program work right away?

In most cases everything should work on the first try, but **if it doesn't, install .NET Framework 4.8 or later.**

2. Does the program work on every operating system?

Since it's a bat file, it's obvious that it will only work on Windows systems. The script also uses some modern Powershell features, so it will work on **Windows 10 and up.**

3. Can I add feature X?

Absolutely! Hit that fork button, and play away!
